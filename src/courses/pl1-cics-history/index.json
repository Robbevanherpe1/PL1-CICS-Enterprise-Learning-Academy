Officially introduced in <strong>1964</strong>, PL/I combined the computational power of <code>FORTRAN</code> with the data-handling features of <code>COBOL</code>.</p>\n  <img src='images/360.jpg' alt='IBM System/360' class='rounded-xl shadow-md w-full max-w-lg mx-auto'>\n  <p>Early compilers ran on IBM 7090 and System/360 mainframes, pioneering structured programming, recursion, and multitasking. Through the 1970s–1980s, IBM enhanced PL/I with structured constructs, advanced I/O, and strong exception handling for enterprise reliability.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id='features' class='space-y-4'>\n  <h2 class='text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 border-b border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 pb-2'>Technical Features and Syntax</h2>\n  <p>PL/I supports a wide range of data types including <code>FIXED</code>, <code>FLOAT</code>, <code>COMPLEX</code>, and bit strings. Its control structures — <code>DO</code>, <code>IF</code>, and <code>SELECT</code> — allowed for clear, modular programming.</p>\n  <p>Its <strong>exception handling</strong> mechanism using <code>ON</code> conditions influenced later languages such as Ada and C. PL/I also supported <strong>tasking and multitasking</strong>, enabling concurrent execution and efficient mainframe use.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id='integration' class='space-y-4'>\n  <h2 class='text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 border-b border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 pb-2'>Integration with IBM Mainframe</h2>\n  <p>PL/I was designed to fully leverage IBM mainframes, particularly <code>z/OS</code>, <code>MVS</code>, and <code>VM</code>. It works seamlessly with <code>VSAM</code> for file access, <code>IMS</code> for transactions, and <code>DB2</code> for database integration.</p>\n  <img src='images/original.jpg' alt='Mainframe environment' class='rounded-xl shadow-md w-full max-w-lg mx-auto'>\n  <p>Using IBM’s <strong>Enterprise PL/I Compiler</strong> and <strong>Debug Tool</strong>, developers can build and maintain reliable systems interoperable with <code>COBOL</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>Assembler</code> through IBM’s Language Environment (LE).</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id='legacy' class='space-y-4'>\n  <h2 class='text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 border-b border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 pb-2'>Legacy and Modern Relevance</h2>\n  <p>While modern languages like C, Java, and Python dominate new development, PL/I remains integral to mainframe modernization. Many financial and government systems continue to rely on millions of lines of PL/I code.</p>\n  <p>Its design influenced future programming paradigms in exception handling, data management, and concurrency, making it a lasting cornerstone of computing history.</p>\n  <div class='flex justify-center my-6'>\n    <iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hYZySxNa97M?start=13&end=69&controls=0' title='PL/I Documentary' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen class='rounded-xl shadow-lg'></iframe>\n  </div>\n</section>",
